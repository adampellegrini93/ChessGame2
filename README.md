# Fuzzy Logic Chess
Fuzzy Logic Chess is a variant of chess where players can play against themselves or against an AI with varying diifculty options.

### Capturing Pieces
This chess variant adds uncertainty to the act of capturing a piece, 
so that players must use reasoning with uncertainty in planning their strategies.
When a player chooses to attack another piece, they must first roll a 6 sided die which determines if the attack was successful
based on the values in the Capture Table.
* When an attack is successful, the attacking piece moves into the square of the captured piece.
* When an attack is unsuccessful, the attacking piece remains in the square it attacked from.
* All pieces may attempt to capture an opposing piece in any direction (left, right, up, down, diagonal).
* Only the Knight may move after an attack. Only the Knight may attack twice.

### Movement Variations
* In addition to their normal movement, all pieces may also move to any unoccupied neighboring square in any direction (left, right, up, down, diagonal).
* Pawns are never promoted after reaching the eighth rank (the opponent’s home row).
* For its first move, a Pawn may move two squares in a straight line.
* The Bishop, Rook and Queen may each move either diagonally or horizontally in a straight line, and may only move up to four squares (not eight).
* No declaration of “check”

### Two Actions in a Turn
* Move two different pieces OR
* Move the Bishop, Rook, or Queen twice, and they may change direction for the second move OR
* Move the Knight twice, each action either using its normal chess movement pattern, OR by moving to an adjacent square OR
* Move both the King and a Rook in a castle move OR
* Move one piece and attack with one piece (can be the same or different pieces) OR
* Make two attacks with any two pieces but move none.
